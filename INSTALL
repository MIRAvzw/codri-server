Subversion JavaHL
-----------------

Codri makes use of the native JavaHL bindings Subversion provides. This means that
you need to install these libraries, and make sure they can be accessed properly.

a) install the bindings
Debian: aptitude install libsvn-java

b) add the native library path to java.properties.path
Debian: nothing to do, /usr/lib/jni already in java.properties.path

c) add the java library to Tomcat's classpath
Debian: ln -s /usr/share/java/svn-javahl.jar /var/lib/tomcat6/shared/svn-javahl.jar
        (assuming shared.loader contains /var/lib/tomcat6/shared/*.jar)
