VERSION 1.0
-----------

* General
  - Unify error handling (exceptions from within subsystems, proper handling at
    controller level)
  - Unify logging (informational message when big things happen, debug messages
    for all events, and trace messages for individual actions; but how to apply
    this in auxiliary systems?)

* Application controller

* Website subsystem
  - Display details for individual machines
  - Allow execution of basic actions

* Network subsystem
  - Find the bug which causes kiosks to disappear from the network topology
    This seems to be some sort of Cling timeout, as starting the workbench after
    this happens results in a successful detection

* Repository subsystem


VERSION 2.0
-----------


FUTURE
------

* Repository subsystem
  - Properly interpret changesets (it be concerning configurations or media)
